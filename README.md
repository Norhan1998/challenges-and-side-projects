# challenges-and-side-projects
Work done outside my main research work

I will be gathering here side work I have done other than what I have published/worked on in an official collaboration. So far, I have added the following:
1. My team's submission for the 2022 IBM Open Science Prize.
2. QxQ final project on using Grover's algorithm for Graph Coloring problems
